Program Structure:

  Front End:
  [Status Update?*, Warning for low supplies?]
    User Enters:
    - Date
    - Circuit Type
      ECMO:
      - Oxygenator Coating
      - Pump Coating
      CRRT:
      - Filter type
      Combo:
      - Oxygenator Coating
      - Pump Coating
      - Filter type
    - Circuit Length [4hr, 6hr, 8hr, 10hr, 24hr]
    - Control [y/n]
    - Control length [same/different]
    - Compound(s)

    *Status Update:
    - How much granularity do we want? Circuit?
    - Add notes
      Status:
      [Run -> Complete -> Shipped -> Data Received | Failed]
      * If failed, don't ship

    Back End:
    [Python]
    [Look into editing .xsls with Python]
    [Naming scheme must be consistent for all files]

    Excel:
    [Should we have an archive system?]
    - Box maps
      [Box, Cell, SampleID, Date, Timepoint]
      - Follow same format for all. Left/Right -> Top/Bottom or A1-9 -> I1 -> 9
      - Check if box exists/has room, if not then create (query spreadsheet?)
      - Begin fill in first empty spot
      - Save file
    - Log of all samples
      [Box, Cell, SampleID, Date, Timepoint, Notes]
      - Pull from box map and concat into one file, notes are added as needed
      - New tab for each compound
    - Log of all circuits
      [Drug, Date, Circuit Type, Filter Type, Oxygenator Type, Pump Type,
      Circuit Number, Circuit Time, Analysis Lab, Status, Storage Location,
      Box, Notes]
      - Use this to query
      - User can update, but restrict
    - Overview of all drugs (high level)
      [Drug, Total samples, # ECMO circuits, # CRRT circuits, # Std Controls,
      # Glass Controls, # Light Controls, # Crystalloid, Class, Lead
      Model?, Initial Ex Vivo (CRRT, ECMO, Control), Lab]
    - Inventory
      - Update all materials used
